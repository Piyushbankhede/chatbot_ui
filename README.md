Chat Bot Deployment with Jenkins, Trivy, Docker, AWS, OWASP, and SonarQube
Overview
This project aims to create a chat bot deployment pipeline using Jenkins as the automation server. The pipeline includes dependency scanning with Trivy, Docker image scanning, deployment on AWS, security scanning with OWASP, and code quality analysis with SonarQube.

Prerequisites
Jenkins installed and configured
Trivy installed (for file or image scanning)
Docker installed
AWS account with necessary permissions
SonarQube server setup and configured
Access to OWASP security tools or libraries
Installation and Setup
Jenkins Setup:
Install Jenkins on your server. Follow the official Jenkins installation guide for detailed instructions.
Configure Jenkins with necessary plugins for Docker, AWS, SonarQube integration, etc.
Trivy Installation:
Install Trivy for vulnerability scanning. Refer to the official Trivy documentation for installation instructions.
Docker Setup:
Install Docker on your system. Follow the Docker installation guide for your specific operating system.
AWS Setup:
Configure AWS credentials with Jenkins. You can use IAM roles or access keys for this purpose. Make sure Jenkins has the necessary permissions to deploy resources on AWS.
SonarQube Setup:
Install and configure SonarQube server. Follow the official SonarQube documentation for installation instructions.
Integrate SonarQube with Jenkins for code quality analysis. Install the SonarQube plugin in Jenkins and configure the connection to your SonarQube server.
OWASP Setup:
Obtain OWASP security tools or libraries relevant to your project. You may need tools like OWASP ZAP, Dependency-Check, etc., depending on your requirements.
Usage
Jenkins Pipeline Configuration:
Create a Jenkins pipeline for your chat bot deployment.
Configure stages in the pipeline for dependency scanning, Docker image building, AWS deployment, OWASP security scanning, SonarQube code analysis, etc.
Utilize Jenkinsfile to define the pipeline stages and their execution sequence.
Trivy Integration:
Integrate Trivy into your pipeline for file or image scanning. Use Trivy commands to scan dependencies or Docker images for vulnerabilities.
Docker Image Building:
Build Docker images as part of your pipeline. Ensure to include necessary security configurations and minimize vulnerabilities.
AWS Deployment:
Deploy your chat bot application on AWS infrastructure using Jenkins pipeline. Utilize AWS services like EC2, ECS, or Lambda as per your requirements.
OWASP Security Scanning:
Incorporate OWASP security tools or libraries into your pipeline for vulnerability scanning and security checks.
SonarQube Code Analysis:
Integrate SonarQube with Jenkins to perform code quality analysis. Analyze code for bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.
